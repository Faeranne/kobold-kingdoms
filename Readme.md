# Kobold Kingdoms

This repo contains the source info for the Kobold Kingdoms pack in [PackWiz](https://packwiz.infra.link) format.  
You may use the contents as you see fit.  Server contents are not posted till after the season is over, and thus
will not match this repo live.

## Building the pack

This pack uses PackWiz format, and thus can be built using the [PackWiz-Installer](https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/installing/packwiz-installer/).
You will need to fetch the required components yourself for that.  Releases will contain the pack in an exported
Modrith format.  No other formats are supported at this time.  The official Modrith published version is accessable
at the [Kobold Kingdoms Modrith page](https://modrinth.com/modpack/kobold-kingdoms).
